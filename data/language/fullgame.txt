adviser_food_doninfirmary2 				[TODO]No one did this to you, pappy. It was an accident.
adviser_food_doninfirmary3 				[TODO]Shut your stinking mouth and listen good. The both of you. 
adviser_food_doninfirmary4 				[TODO]If I knew which of you fucks started that fire, I'd snap your stinking neck!
adviser_food_doninfirmary5 				[TODO]But my time is done. I'm going to die in this fucking bed.
adviser_food_doninfirmary6 				[TODO]And there's a family business to run. The Palermo name is all we've got left. So you do the honourable thing you dirty piece of shit fucks. Capiche?
adviser_food_doninfirmary7				[TODO]We know what to do, pops.
adviser_food_donchat13					[TODO]This isn't over, Nico.
adviser_food_donchat14					[TODO]Watch your fucking back.

adviser_food_founddrugs1				[TODO]You would not believe what I've just been told.

adviser_food_founddrugs4 				[TODO]Some days it doesn't just rain, it pours.

adviser_food_explainneeds4				[TODO]This report shows the combined needs of all your prisoners. Red means a lot of prisoners are angry about this particular need not being met.
adviser_food_explainneeds5 				[TODO]As you'd expect, Food is red for virtually everyone. But these prisoners are also very bored (Recreation need), and the prison is in a pretty shabby state which is reflected in their Environment and Clothing needs.
adviser_food_explainneeds6				[TODO]It's your decision, as the resident prison architect, which needs you will try to attend to first.  You could install televisions in their cells to keep them occupied, and hire some Janitors to clean the place up.

objective_food_handleboredomneed_description 		[TODO]Boredom can be tackled quite effectively by installing televisions in each person's cell. Or you could build a common room and place some tvs and pool tables in there.\n\nYou can also place tvs in shared rooms like the Canteen.

adviser_riot_hostages2 					[TODO]So this is how it works. I ask. You give. 
adviser_riot_hostages3					[TODO]Any problems, send anyone in, or if I even smell a cop, I put a bullet in his skull.
adviser_riot_hostages4 					[TODO]We want an unmarked vehicle. Blacked out windows. Full tank. One hour. I’ll be in touch.
adviser_riot_hostages5 					[TODO]Now, where were we.
adviser_riot_hostages5b					[TODO]What were you doing in that office?
adviser_riot_hostages6					[TODO]I swear, I don't know anything.
adviser_riot_hostages7					[TODO]I seen my own reflection enough to know a man doing wrong.
adviser_riot_hostages8					[TODO]What were you hiding?
adviser_riot_hostages9					[TODO]I belong in a place like this. But the kid...what good did it do anybody, that boy doing more time?
adviser_riot_hostages10					[TODO]You know something, and telling me's the only way to get out here alive.

adviser_riot_hostageheller1 			[TODO]This is completely unacceptable. We need eyes on that canteen so we can see what's happening.
adviser_riot_hostageheller2 			[TODO]There's a small security room to the north of the canteen. We need to secure it.
adviser_riot_hostageheller3 			[TODO]Deploy some Guards in there to man the CCTV console, and we'll get vision of the whole cell block.

adviser_riot_rouletteintro1             [TODO]We've got a guard in the security room, so we're getting the live pictures from the CCTV camera system.
adviser_riot_rouletteintro2             [TODO]Let's take a look at the hostage situation.
adviser_riot_click 						[TODO]<click>
adviser_riot_roulette1					[TODO]Last chance to walk out of here, boss man. Ever play two-ball tag?
adviser_riot_roulette2 					[TODO]Two bullets. Four empty chambers. 
adviser_riot_roulette2b 				[TODO]Used to play this with Jackrabbits. We'd blow their heads clean off. 
adviser_riot_roulette3 					[TODO]But you'll work just the same.
adviser_riot_roulette4 					[TODO]Let's start with a simple question. What were you doing in that office?
adviser_riot_roulette5 					[TODO]I swear, I don't know anything.
adviser_riot_roulette5b 				[TODO]Really.
adviser_riot_roulette6 					[TODO]Fine. Who goes first? You? Me? What about this guy?
adviser_riot_roulette7					[TODO]What do you know. Just like a Jackrabbit.
adviser_riot_roulette8 					[TODO]WHAT WAS IN THOSE FILES?
adviser_riot_roulette9 					[TODO]I swear! I don't know...
adviser_riot_roulette10 				[TODO]Luck's running out. Still a bullet in there somewhere. And I know what I saw.
adviser_riot_roulette11b 				[TODO]Couldn't believe my own eyes.
adviser_riot_roulette11c 				[TODO]The big company man himself, here in my prison. Looking guilty as fuck. 
adviser_riot_roulette11d 				[TODO]I’m guessing there was more in those files than just my rap sheet.
adviser_riot_roulette11					[TODO]Please... please don't. 
adviser_riot_roulette11e 				[TODO]Odds are getting shorter, Wallace.
adviser_riot_roulette12 				[TODO]I tell you what, I'll make it easier for you.
adviser_riot_roulette12b	 			[TODO]Alright, enough with this bullshit.
adviser_riot_roulette13 				[TODO]It's your turn, motherfucker.  Unless you tell me what I want to know.
adviser_riot_roulette14 				[TODO]I can't. Please.
adviser_riot_roulette15 				[TODO]Okay! Please! Please. Don't shoot. It was money. It was all money.
adviser_riot_roulette16 				[TODO]That's it?
adviser_riot_roulette17 				[TODO]You're valuable commodities. The longer any of you are in here, the more profit we make. We were just bending the rules. 
adviser_riot_roulette17b				[TODO]That file was the proof.
adviser_riot_roulette18 				[TODO]So what are we worth? What do you get for keeping us inside?
adviser_riot_roulette19 				[TODO]Seventy three thousand dollars a year.
adviser_riot_roulette20					[TODO]Each? Sonofabitch. It's time for you to start paying back.

adviser_riot_assault02 					[TODO]The team is all in position. 
adviser_riot_assault03					[TODO]I want my wheels now. Wallace is joining us. And if I catch sight of a tail you’ll be scraping pieces of him off the freeway.
adviser_riot_assault2 					[TODO]Right then, big man. You're coming with us. They won't risk anything stupid with you riding shotgun.
adviser_riot_assault3 					[TODO]None of us are getting out of here. It’s not you they want.
adviser_riot_assault4 					[TODO]What you talking about?
adviser_riot_assault5					[TODO]I did it for money. But HE did it for political gain. The longer the sentences, the more votes he got.
adviser_riot_assault6					[TODO]Who the fuck you talking about?
adviser_riot_assault7					[TODO]Mayor Heller. It was his blueprint. I just oiled the wheels. 
adviser_riot_assault7b 					[TODO]Those files were the evidence that could destroy his career.
adviser_riot_assault8					[TODO]You are shitting me.
adviser_riot_assault9 					[TODO]What the fuck...

# Riot Objectives and help text

adviser_name_negotiator 				[TODO]The Negotiator

adviser_riot_negotiator1 				[TODO]It's out of control here. Nobody is in charge.
adviser_riot_negotiator2 				[TODO]We've got multiple casualties, and the remaining guards won't go into the rioting cell blocks.  We've had to pull back to the perimeter.
adviser_riot_negotiator3 				[TODO]Figure out what to do, and put a stop to this before it gets out of hand.
adviser_riot_negotiator4 				[TODO]Riot police should be here in a few minutes.

adviser_riot_firstreinforcements1 		[TODO]The first of the response teams has arrived. 
adviser_riot_firstreinforcements2 	 	[TODO]These guys are Riot Guards, and they're much more heavily armoured. Use these guys to start retaking the captured prison wings. 
adviser_riot_firstreinforcements3 		[TODO]We've also got some paramedics from the nearby state hospital.  
adviser_riot_firstreinforcements4 		[TODO]I suggest you use them to give emergency medical attention to your Riot Guards as they retake the prison.

objective_Riot_StopTheRiot 				[TODO]Stop the riot
objective_Riot_StopTheRiot_description  [TODO]Nobody is in charge. You need to figure out what to do.

adviser_riot_helleradvice1				[TODO]I assume this is the CEO's deputy with whom I'm speaking. 
adviser_riot_helleradvice2 				[TODO]I appreciate this is a very difficult time and we are all under intense scrutiny. Rest assured, you have my full support in using any and all resources at your disposal. 
adviser_riot_deployguards1				[TODO]We've gained a foot hold, and retaken some of the prison. And the loss of life so far is completely justifiable.
adviser_riot_deployguards2				[TODO]But before you push on and retake the rest of the prison, you should re-secure the wings that you have captured.
adviser_riot_deployguards3				[TODO]Hire some guards and assign them to the recaptured sectors from the Deployment screen. They will ensure the captured wings stay captured.
adviser_riot_deployguards4 				[TODO]Once you've taken care of that, push into the remaining zones and put these monsters down. These animals can't be rehabilitated. And they can't be negotiated with.
adviser_riot_deployguards5 				[TODO]I'm working on authorising an Armed Response team that will put an end to this quick.

adviser_riot_infirmary1 				[TODO]You've got wounded all over the prison, and more to come no doubt. You can't just leave them to bleed to death. 
adviser_riot_infirmary2 				[TODO]Build an Infirmary somewhere on site, and hire Doctors to treat the injured.
adviser_riot_infirmary3 				[TODO]We've also seen quite a few bodies.  For the sake of their dignity, we need to build a Morgue and start collecting them up.
adviser_riot_infirmary4					[TODO]You'll need to hire workmen to do the construction work. Be sure to keep them safe.

objective_Riot_ResecureWings 			[TODO]Hire guards and deploy them to the recaptured zones
objective_riot_medicalneeds				[TODO](OPTIONAL) Tend to the medical needs of your prison
objective_Riot_Infirmary				[TODO](Optional) Build an Infirmary and treat the wounded
objective_Riot_Morgue 					[TODO](Optional) Build a Morgue and collect the dead
objective_Riot_SecureGenPop				[TODO]Recapture the Gen-Pop wing (central)
objective_Riot_SecureSpecialWing		[TODO]Recapture the Special wing (west)
objective_Riot_SecureMaxSec				[TODO]Recapture the Max-Sec wing (south)
objective_riot_putoutfires				[TODO]Bring the fire under control

adviser_riot_secondreinforcements1		[TODO]More Riot Guards have arrived.

adviser_riot_armedreinforcements1		[TODO]The Mayor has brought in some armed police from the nearby police station.
adviser_riot_armedreinforcements2		[TODO]Be careful with these guys. You might just end up with a bloodbath on your hands if you let them loose.
adviser_riot_armedreinforcements3		[TODO]On the other hand, the prisoners may choose to surrender when they see these guys coming in.

adviser_riot_reinforcementsunlocked1 	[TODO]The main bulk of the reinforcements have arrived.
adviser_riot_reinforcementsunlocked2 	[TODO]You can now call up as many squads of Riot Police and Paramedics as you need, from the Emergencies toolbar.

adviser_riot_cleanup1                   [TODO]The facility is under control, and the rioters have been subdued. It could easily have turned out a lot worse.
adviser_riot_cleanup2                   [TODO]We've got one hell of a clean-up operation ahead of us. I'd appreciate your help with that, if you've the time.
adviser_riot_cleanup2b 					[TODO]We don't have any building contractors on site, so the first step will be to hire some new workmen to get to work repairing the place.
adviser_riot_cleanup3                   [TODO]I always thought security here was much too lax. These inmates have been given too much free rein for too long. That stops today.
adviser_riot_cleanup4                   [TODO]I want you to build us a new Armoury, then deploy armed guards at key positions around the prison. The sight of that will subdue these prisoners and they'll think twice about causing this much trouble again.
adviser_riot_cleanup5                   [TODO]I'm also approving the funds to provide body armour to all guards on site. Our men need to be able to defend themselves.
adviser_riot_cleanup6                   [TODO]Let's continue. These prisoners need discipline. Order in their lives. I suggest we put them to work tidying up the mess they've made.
adviser_riot_cleanup7                   [TODO]Start up a labour program for our inmates, and put them to work cleaning the prison and doing the laundry.
adviser_riot_cleanup7b                  [TODO]You can assign prisoners to work from the toolbar, under Logistics. Highlight the objective for more detailed help on how to do this.
adviser_riot_cleanup8                   [TODO]We've a few other requirements. There are a lot of prisoners who need to be taught the error of their ways. Build a new Solitary Confinement wing.
adviser_riot_cleanup8b                  [TODO]Our guards will take care of moving inmates to Solitary as required. Solitary Confinement gives inmates time to reflect on what they've done, and reminds them who is in charge around here.
adviser_riot_cleanup9                   [TODO]And let's not forget the staff, who made it through this ordeal with us. They are exhausted.
adviser_riot_cleanup9b 					[TODO]Build a staff room somewhere to give them somewhere to recover.
adviser_riot_cleanup10                  [TODO]Finally, we need to bring all of this in on a budget. Make sure we have a positive bank balance and cash-flow. 
adviser_riot_cleanup10b 				[TODO]Prisoner labour is substantially cheaper than contractors when it comes to cleaning, janitorial work, laundry and the like. 
adviser_riot_cleanup11                  [TODO]There's a lot to do here. We really appreciate your help.
adviser_riot_cleanup12                  [TODO]Once you feel you've done enough and are ready to move on, click on the polaroid by the front gates.

adviser_riot_cleanup13 					[TODO]Excellent work. I think the security of this facility is looking much stronger now.

conviction_intro_3                      [TODO]There have been a spate of suicides at this facility recently, and it's not hard to see why. But we have a more immediate problem.
conviction_intro_4                      [TODO]The powers that be have decided to send us a huge batch of new inmates. The first will be arriving tomorrow, and we don't have anywhere to house them.

conviction_workintro1                   [TODO]We've treated these men like dirt for too long. That ends now.
conviction_workintro2                   [TODO]The previous CEO was never a big believer in prisoner reform.  But the way I see it, we need to provide these men with some sense of hope for the future.
conviction_workintro3                   [TODO]We need to give them the skills they need to succeed when they're released - valuable trade skills, a basic education.
conviction_workintro4                   [TODO]We should start a work apprenticeship scheme.  Train these men with some real world skills, so they at least have a future they can look forward to.


conviction_hurst1 						[TODO]The lack of engagement at this facility is shocking. Men deprived of every shred of humanity.

conviction_hurst3 						[TODO]It's not what these men deserve.
conviction_hurst4 						[TODO]Indeed, Captain. This is no way to treat a human being. They're deprived of every shred of humanity. 
conviction_hurst4b 						[TODO]Why should they abide by our rules? You can’t expect them to respond in any way but with the utmost resentment. 
conviction_hurst4c						[TODO]We need classrooms, drug rehabilitation programs. A workshop, so they can start to take some pride in their skills.

conviction_visitation_1					[TODO]Behind the line.
conviction_visitation_2 				[TODO]I'm sorry. I'm here to see Henry. Henry Morgan. He's my husband, sir.
conviction_visitation_3 				[TODO]I won't tell you again. Behind the line. Now.
conviction_visitation_4 				[TODO]Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
conviction_visitation_5 				[TODO]Okay. Come forward. I haven't got all day.
conviction_visitation_6					[TODO]Name.
conviction_visitation_7					[TODO]Kerry Morgan, sir. Here to see Henry Morgan. And this here's his baby girl.
conviction_visitation_8					[TODO]That's what you tell him is it?  Go on through.
conviction_visitation_8a                [TODO]Kerry!
conviction_visitation_9					[TODO]Afraid there's been a mistake. Morgan's lost his visitation privileges.
conviction_visitation_9b 				[TODO]What? 
conviction_visitation_9c 				[TODO]I'm sorry. We found liquor in his cell this morning. There's nothing I can do.
conviction_visitation_10				[TODO]It took me two hours to get here. My daughter's crying. This isn't fair.
conviction_visitation_11				[TODO]You want fair, go to Disneyland. Fair is somewhere you win goldfish and eat hot dogs. You won't find it here.
conviction_visitation_12				[TODO]Please, give him this.
conviction_visitation_13                [TODO]Sure thing. He won’t be having visitors for quite some time. Any message?
conviction_visitation_14                [TODO]No. No message.

conviction_visitation_angrymorgan0		[TODO]No!
conviction_visitation_angrymorgan1		[TODO]Wait!
conviction_visitation_angrymorgan2		[TODO]You can't do this!
conviction_visitation_angrymorgan3		[TODO]Let me talk to her!
conviction_visitation_angrymorgan4		[TODO]You fucking assholes!

conviction_helpinmates_1                [TODO]That is very disappointing.
conviction_helpinmates_2                [TODO]It is so difficult to find ways to genuinely help these men. They really need to be taught to help themselves.
conviction_helpinmates_3                [TODO]I think it's clear we need to tackle the visitation facility. Families are queuing out the door, and we clearly can't handle the volume of visitors we are now seeing.
conviction_helpinmates_4                [TODO]Build a brand new visitation facility. Despite what happened to Morgan, I think we'll see a positive benefit. And he isn't the only inmate here with family.
conviction_helpinmates_5                [TODO]I've been doing some research and I'm astonished to find that many of these inmates have only the most basic maths and reading skills. We need to start to remedy this.
conviction_helpinmates_6                [TODO]Open up a new classroom facility, and let's start bringing in external teachers to teach the basics. Without education, these inmates have no hope of anything other than a life of crime.
conviction_helpinmates_7                [TODO]And we need to keep on top of the influx of prisoners. Keep expanding our capacity so that every inmate gets a decent quality cell.

conviction_outro1                       [TODO]I think we've made a big difference here. We've given these inmates something to work towards, and a reason to keep going.
conviction_outro2                       [TODO]You can stay and help us see the first batch of inmates through the education and work programs we've set up, if you want.
conviction_outro3                       [TODO]But I think we can handle it from here. When you are ready to leave, click on the polaroid in Morgan's cell.

conviction_secondvisit_1                [TODO]I was hoping to see you at one of my sessions.
conviction_secondvisit_2                [TODO]I can’t do it. I can’t stay in this hole any longer.
conviction_secondvisit_3                [TODO]Just take it a day at a time.
conviction_secondvisit_4                [TODO]I mean the whole stinking place. In here. Out there. They won't let me see my family. I messed up, sir, and that ain’t about to change.

campaignchapter_epilogue_description    [TODO]A historic prison is scheduled for demolition and replacement. Use all the skills you've learnt to create the ultimate facility.

adviser_name_reporter 					[TODO]Reporter

epilogue_newsintro1 					[TODO]Today on CNDC news, a special report into the state of our prisons.
epilogue_newsintro2 					[TODO]It’s two years since the infamous 'Siege at Alchemico' claimed so many lives, including that of Chief Executive Charles Wallace. 
epilogue_newsintro4 					[TODO]Today we hear from leading experts and ask what, if anything, has changed since those tragic events. 
epilogue_newsintro5 					[TODO]First we go live to one of the state's longest running prisons, recently scheduled for demolition.
epilogue_newsintro6						[TODO]Live now, only on CNDC news.

epilogue_reporter1						[TODO]Thanks Sarah. This prison has housed some of the country’s most notorious criminals.  
epilogue_reporter2 						[TODO]But now, its walls are being torn down, ready to be replaced by a new prison complex.
epilogue_reporter3 						[TODO]If you look behind me, you can see that the construction crews are already here, and demolition work has begun.
epilogue_reporter4 						[TODO]Joining me is city Mayor, Calvin Heller. Thank you Mr Heller for taking the time to talk to us today.
epilogue_reporter5 						[TODO]It’s my pleasure.

epilogue_reporter6 						[TODO]In the past you've been a strong advocate of a tougher, more disciplined approach to prison management.
epilogue_reporter6b 					[TODO]Why demolish a facility which has defined, for so long, the punitive approach?
epilogue_reporter7 						[TODO]Both the prison and its operation had become antiquated. 
epilogue_reporter8 						[TODO]We took the decision to replace it with an entirely new facility. One with a more modern policy.
epilogue_reporter9						[TODO]This prison was in the news a few years ago as one of the last remaining state execution facilities.
epilogue_reporter10 					[TODO]Campaigners have long sought to revoke the death penalty laws here. Will you honour their wishes, or will you rebuild the execution facility?
epilogue_reporter12 					[TODO]That’s still under review. But it’s not a decision we’ll take lightly.

epilogue_reporterend1 					[TODO]Thank you Mayor Heller. Back to you in the studio.
epilogue_newstransition1 				[TODO]This is CNDC news, reporting live on the state of our prison system.
epilogue_newstransition2 				[TODO]After the break, we'll be joined by Doctor Walter Hurst, a specialist in prisoner psychology and rehabilitation.

epilogue_parole1 						[TODO]Still nothing? How long’s that?
epilogue_parole2						[TODO]I lost count. No calls. No letters.
epilogue_parole3 						[TODO]I'm sorry Morgan. That’s got to hurt. But you’ve got a chance here. Don’t mess up.
epilogue_parole4 						[TODO]Henry. Good luck.
epilogue_parole5 						[TODO]Don't try to tell them what you think they want to hear.
epilogue_parole6 						[TODO]I have to go. I'm live on air in one minute.
epilogue_parole7                        [TODO]Mayor Heller, what is your opinion?
epilogue_parole10 						[TODO]That was fast!
epilogue_parole11 						[TODO]Well?
epilogue_parole12                       [TODO]...

epilogue_outro_1 						[TODO]Welcome back to this special edition of CNDC news, live with city Mayor Calvin Heller.
epilogue_outro_2 						[TODO]Joining us now is Doctor Walter Hurst, who has been accused of squandering huge sums of money on prison reform.
epilogue_outro_2b 						[TODO]Dr Hurst, Do you believe you've achieved success?
epilogue_outro_3						[TODO]Success? No. Not in general. 
epilogue_outro_4						[TODO]I believe everyone has the potential for improvement. And we must offer them that chance.
epilogue_outro_4b 						[TODO]I can state with absolute conviction that I've seen real improvement in the attitude and hopes of many of those incarcerated here.
epilogue_outro_5						[TODO]Incarceration should be a deterrent. It should not be an opportunity for development or change.
epilogue_outro_6 						[TODO]Punishing and dehumanising them during their experience only serves to nurture delinquency. 

epilogue_outro_7						[TODO]We provide these men with valuable skills, but more importantly, hope.
epilogue_outro_7b  						[TODO]We are helping them to integrate back into society, and contribute after they leave.
epilogue_outro_8						[TODO]Ordinary citizens don't get free training. Free education. Guaranteed paid work. 
epilogue_outro_8b 						[TODO]We are neglecting the victims of crime, and rewarding the perpetrators.
epilogue_outro_8c 						[TODO]Spending vast sums, simply to make these criminals feel good about themselves.
epilogue_outro_9						[TODO]We can make a difference, even if we have to do it one individual at a time.
epilogue_outro_10						[TODO]These men haven't earned their freedoms. Their liberties.
epilogue_outro_11						[TODO]You can tell a tomcat a hundred times to leave the birds in your back yard alone. But he’ll always come back.
epilogue_outro_12 						[TODO]It’s in his nature.

epilogue_sandbox_1                      [TODO]Let me congratulate you on your appointment as CEO. This is an opportunity. A fresh start.
epilogue_sandbox_2                      [TODO]You'll have complete autonomy, more or less. More prisoners. Higher re-offending rates. You have a lot of challenges ahead of you.
epilogue_sandbox_3						[TODO]As for the death row facility, tear it down. Or keep it, make some use out of it. It really is up to you. Somebody else will take up that business if you won't. 
epilogue_sandbox_4						[TODO]As for objectives, I'm giving you the same as I gave to your predessessor. Profits, re-offending rates, capacity. 
epilogue_sandbox_5 						[TODO]It's entirely up to you how you achieve them.
epilogue_sandbox_5b                     [TODO]One last thing. The previous CEO Charles Wallace left behind a letter that he used to give out to any new prison architects who joined the firm.
epilogue_sandbox_5c                     [TODO]He had some good advice. You may find it useful to take a look.
epilogue_sandbox_6						[TODO]Good luck!

objective_epilogue_grants				[TODO]Raise money through the Grants system
objective_epilogue_grants_description   [TODO]Grants are one of the primary methods of raising the large volumes of cash needed to build a prison.\n\nYou can find a whole host of grants in the Reports (bottom right of the screen) under 'Grants'. Various agencies will offer you funds to build specific parts of your prison from scratch.

epilogue_outrointro_2                   [TODO]If you are near a tv, you should turn it on now. Something I want you to see.

epilogue_basiccompletion_1 				[TODO]You've achieved the minimum requirements for a state prison. Where you go from here is up to you.
epilogue_basiccompletion_2 				[TODO]At this point it is completely up to you and your company how you proceed.
epilogue_basiccompletion_3 				[TODO]At the Mayor's office there is only one number that we care about, and that is the re-offending rate.
epilogue_basiccompletion_4	 			[TODO]If you can reduce re-offending rates amoungst your prisoners, I'd call that a success.
epilogue_basiccompletion_5 				[TODO]People like Doctor Hurst believe you can only achive that through education, reform, skills training and the like.
epilogue_basiccompletion_6 				[TODO]In my opinion, punishment can be just as effective a method.
epilogue_basiccompletion_8 				[TODO]It's up to you.  I wish you the best of luck!
epilogue_basiccompletion_9 				[TODO]When you are done, click on the polaroid on the road to leave the prison.

escapemode_help_title                   [TODO]Escape - It's your only way out
escapemode_help                         [TODO]Step One: Reputation - Your reputation means everything in here\n\n• Boost your reputation by starting fights. Hurting people will really get you noticed but breaking things is a good place to start. The more damage you can cause in one fight the better.\n• Leave no witnesses. If a guard spots you fighting you'll get punished for it, unless of course they're no longer around.\n• Getting knocked out looks bad. You're better off ending a fight on your own terms.\n\nStep Two: Squad - Recruit others to join your escape attempt\n\n• Whistle to call them over and they'll stick with you everywhere you go. (Click their name in the top left)\n• They'll even join you in fights which can help you increase your reputation even faster.\n• Train up your squad. You'll never know when having a skilled fighter or competitive sprinter nearby will end up being useful.\n\nStep Three: Contraband - You'll need weapons and tools\n\n• Find a room where there will be something you want. Take a look around and you'll quickly find something useful you can steal.\n• Watch out for metal detectors and guards trying to search you. If you're found with anything they'll grab it and throw you in solitary.\n• Stash your equipment. You can hide your findings in your cell or the cells of others, just remember where you've left things.\n\nStep Four: Tunnels - The quiet way out\n\n• Grab a digging tool and start a tunnel from the toilet in your cell.\n• Digging is slow. Get your squad members to help you dig.\n• Don't get spotted. If a guard sees you entering or exiting a tunnel you'll be rumbled.\n\nGood luck. You're going to need it.
