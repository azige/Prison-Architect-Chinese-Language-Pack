researchtooltip_warden                  Unlocks the Warden, and the entire Bureaucracy system.  Hire him from the Staff toolbar.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_security                Unlocks the Chief of Security, who can be hired from the staff toolbar.  The chief gives you access to the Deployment screen, and will also give you a realtime report of the danger level of your prison, often predicting future trouble.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_maintenance             Unlocks the Foreman.  Hire him from the Staff toolbar.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_legal                   Unlocks the Lawyer, who can be hired from the Staff toolbar. Unlocks a number of research options to give you greater control over your prison.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_deployment              Allows you to permanently station Guards to the sectors of your Prison.
researchtooltip_patrols                 Allows you to define patrols around crucial areas of your prison (eg the perimeter), and assign guards to walk those patrols.
researchtooltip_dogs                    Unlocks the Dog Handler and Guard Dog.  They excel in sniffing out the smelly contraband in your prison, and detecting escape tunnels.\n\nDogs are also very fast which allows them to chase prisoners with ease. 
researchtooltip_cctv                    Unlocks CCtv cameras and security monitors.  Use these to keep watch on unmanned parts of your prison.\n\nAlso unlocks the Phone Tap system, which allows you to listen in on prisoner phone calls and gain vital intelligence.

researchtooltip_riotguards              (CURRENTLY SERVES NO PURPOSE)\nUnlocks the Riot Guard.  These guys are armoured and better able to deal with violent situations.
researchtooltip_maintainance            Unlocks the Foreman.  He allows you to do further research on things like Prison Labour, or additional staff members like the Gardener.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_clone                   Unlocks the clone tool on the main toolbar.  Use this tool to rapidly duplicate areas of your prison, such as Cells.  To use, select a zone to be copied with a right mouse drag, then left click to stamp down a copy.
researchtooltip_groundskeeping          Unlocks the Gardener.  He will keep your outdoor areas tidy.
researchtooltip_cleaning                Unlocks the Janitor.  He will clean all the indoor areas of your prison and can also help with the prison laundry service.
researchtooltip_health                  Unlocks the Doctor, along with the Infirmary and the Morgue.  Injured prisoners and staff will be taken to the Infirmary and Doctors will patch them up.
researchtooltip_MentalHealth            Unlocks the Psychologist, providing you with a valuable insight into your Prisoner's internal psychological state at all times.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_finance                 Unlocks the Accountant, which gives access to the financial report for your Prison.\n\nAlso allows you to spend more each day than your income would normally allow, assuming you have the funds in reserve.\n\nLike all Administrators, she requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_landexpansion           Authorises you to purchase neighbouring plots of land, and thereby expand the size of your prison beyond its initial bounds.
researchtooltip_prisonlabour            Allows you to put your prisoners to work around your prison (Cooking, Cleaning etc), saving you on staff wages, earning you money, and teaching your prisoners new skills at the same time.\n\nAlso Unlocks the Workshop and the Laundry.
researchtooltip_education               Unlocks the ability to run educational reform programs for your prisoners, using externally hired teachers. 
researchtooltip_contraband              Training for your Guards to become better at tracking and recovering contraband. Unlocks the contraband Supply and Demand report, the Contraband overlay (showing all possible theft locations within your prison), and tracks all recovered contraband back to where it was smuggled or stolen.\n\nAlso unlocks the ability to recruit prisoners as Confidential Informants.\n\nAlso unlocks the gang intelligence view.
researchtooltip_policy                  Unlocks the Policy Report, allowing you to increase and decrease the punishments for all types of misconduct, as well as automatically triggering searches of the misbehaving prisoner and his cell.\n\nAlso allows you to control the nutritional policy, changing the quantity and variety of food served to prisoners. 
researchtooltip_armoury                 Unlocks the armoury room, and allows you to deploy armed guards throughout your prison.
researchtooltip_bodyarmour              Equips all your Guards, Armed Guards and Dog Handlers with body armour. This can help absorb damage during a fight, but your guards will move slower.\n\nGuards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for all body armour purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazers                  Allows your Armed Guards to carry Tazers, a potent single-shot weapon that will render most targets unconscious instantly. Tazers can only be fired once before they need a full hour to recharge.\n\nArmed Guards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazersforeveryone       Extends the Tazer program so that your regular Guards may also carry Tazers for defense.\n\nThey must visit the Armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_bankloans               Allows you to borrow large lump sums of money from the bank, in exchange for a daily payment of interest. Paying off your loans will increase your credit rating and allow you to borrow larger sums later.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes1             Takes advantage of government tax incentives and reduces your effective Corporation Tax rate to just 15%.\n\nYou will save $1,500 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes2             Your accountant stretches the rules to breaking point, and moves all your official accounts and business processes to a foreign country with highly preferential tax rates. Your effective Corporation tax liability will drop to around 1%.\n\nYou will save a total of $3,000 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_extragrant              Enables you to accept up to three grants simultaneously instead of two.
researchtooltip_advancedmanagement      Gives you the tools to micro manage aspects of your prison so they meet your exact requirements.\n\nUnlocks Food logistics, allowing you to specify which kitchens cook for which canteens, and which canteens inmates eat in.  Similarly, Laundry logistics lets you override which cell blocks are covered by which laundries.\n\nAlso unlocks the Deployment Scheduler, which lets you customise your guard deployment at different times of day.\n\nUnlocks the Reform Program Scheduler, letting you manually override the daily schedule of programs.
researchtooltip_permanentpunishment     Sometimes being in Prison just isn't locked away enough. Your lawyer can file the necessary papers to let you confine prisoners to a cell, permanently. 
researchtooltip_removemincellsize       The cells in your prison require a certain amount of space to fit legal requirements. But imagine how many more cells you could fit in if that wasn't the case! Removes the minimum size requirements for standard cells.
researchtooltip_reduceexecutionliability Your lawyer lobbies for a reduction in the required strength of the conviction before death row proceedings can be properly started. Essentially lowers the number of appeals a prisoner gets before you can schedule their execution without liability.
researchtooltip_legalprep               Every prison runs into problems every now and then, and some of them come with fairly big legal consequences. Your lawyer will start the paperwork to help keep the heat off you should something go wrong, but this needs to be done in advance.
researchtooltip_legaldefense            You're in a bad situation - something went terribly wrong and you've been put on notice. If it looks like you aren't going to be able to manage the situation, your lawyer can help get you off the hook. Completing this research will remove any current warnings that might otherwise result in you being fired.

research_legaldefense_adviser1          It looks like your lawyer has filed some paperwork that is protecting you from the consequences of this mess. I guess that means I can't fire you. This time.
research_legaldefense_adviser2          Get your prison in order, quickly, and make sure it stays in line. That trick won't work again and it won't protect you forever.

In return the bank will charge you interest each day which you must pay out of your cashflow.\n\nAs you make regular payments your credit rating will increase, and the bank will allow you to borrow more. However if you miss payments your credit rating will be decimated and the bank will refuse to lend you more when you need it.\n\nNote: Your loan will never be paid off by daily interest payments alone.

victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths1   Yesterday was a very dark chapter in the history of this prison. Far too many people lost their lives here.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths2   Make sure nobody else dies today, or you will face prosecution for criminal negligence.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths1    Don't say we didn't warn you. You have been found guilty of criminal negligence because of recent events here.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths2    You will now spend the next ten years in prison as punishment for your crime. Your own prison. Good luck.
victory_adviserwarning_riot1            Your prison is out of control. Put down this riot now, or the government will step in and retake the prison by force.
victory_advisernotice_riot1             You have failed to control this riot. The government has revoked our prison contract, and is now sending in the national guard to retake the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes1  We have a PR disaster brewing here. Far too many prisoners have escaped recently, and it's your fault.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes2  Lock this place down and make sure nobody else escapes, otherwise the press will expect your head on a platter.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes1   You have failed. This prison is a laughing stock in the media, and they want somebody to blame.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes2   That somebody is you.  You're fired.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt1        We are bankrupt! Your disastrous management has led us to financial ruin.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt2        Find a way to fix this soon or you will be fired.
victory_advisernotice_bankrupt1         We have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and put the prison into administration. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths1    Working for you has become much too hazardous. We're struggling to find wardens who want to work at the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths2    If you let another warden die, we will have no choice but to fire you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths1     You have failed to provide a safe working environment for your wardens. Everyone is afraid to work for you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths2     We have no choice by to let you go. You are fired.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders1     A lot of the prisoners you have put up for early release have gone on to commit new crimes. This could cost us if we don't take control of the situation.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders2     If too many more prisoners reoffend upon release, you'll be the one to take the blame.
victory_advisernotice_reoffenders1      You have released too many dangerous criminals into the world. We have no choice but let you go. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_executions1      This is the second time that you have put an innocent prisoner to death. The public outrage is enormous.
victory_adviserwarning_executions2      If another innocent prisoner is executed, you will be held responsible.
victory_advisernotice_executions1       You have allowed too many innocent people to be executed. We can not longer allow you to run this prison. You have failed.
victory_advisernotice_InnocentsExecuted1 You've just executed someone without following the proper procedure, and it turns out they were innocent. This is a gross  miscarriage of justice, and you are responsible. You're fired, and will probably be jailed yourself.

score_tooltip_punishment                This is a grading of how well the prisoner has been punished for his crimes, as perceived by the public. Serving a long term in prison is the foundation of a strong punishment, but hard times locked up alone will also count towards it.\n\nKeep in mind that too much reform or free time will be seen as 'soft on crime' and will count against their punishment grade.\n\nA strong punishment score will deter the prisoner from re-offending after release.
score_tooltip_reform                    A grading of how well you have attempted to reform and rehabilitate this prisoner through the use of Reform programs.\n\nA high reform score will give the prisoner a much greater chance of finding genuine employment after release, and will therefore reduce his re-offending chance.\n\nNote: Putting your prisoners to work around the prison also counts towards this.
score_tooltip_health                    A record of the prisoners health and well-being during his stay in your prison. Outdoor exercise and good food count towards this. Injures that go untreated, drugs and alcohol usage all count against it.\n\nA poor score here will increase his chance of re-offending, particularly if the prisoner leaves prison with untreated drug or alcohol dependencies.
score_tooltip_security                  A grading that represents how well you have kept this prisoner safely locked away. Keeping prisoners locked in their cells under armed guard will count heavily towards this. You will be penalised if the prisoner is involved in fights, murders or escape attempts.\n\nA low score indicates the prisoner simply continued his criminal existence once inside your prison, and hence his re-offending chance will be high upon leaving.

score_tooltip_reoffendingchance         An estimate of the prisoners likelihood to re-offend after leaving prison. Many factors are taken into account to produce this value:\n\n- DECREASE Harsh/strong punishment\n- DECREASE Successful reform programs\n- INCREASE Poor health and security\n- INCREASE Untreated drug and alcohol addictions\n- INCREASE Gang membership\n\n\n- The prisoner's age is a major factor.\n- The number of prior convictions is a strong indicator.\n- A large supporting family can help.
score_tooltip_clemencychance_title      Likelihood of Clemency
score_tooltip_clemencychance            The likelihood that the Appeals Board will grant clemency and commute the prisoners death row sentence. Each unsuccessful appeal lowers this value until it is below the State Approved Conviction Strength, at which point full authorisation to proceed is given. Scheduling the execution before this point will result in extreme penalties if it is later found that the prisoner's appeal would have succeeded.\n\nIf clemency is granted, the prisoner will be immediately released (if found innocent), or transferred to Maximum Security (if still judged as guilty.)
score_tooltip_currentchance             The State Approved Conviction Strength is *X%
score_tooltip_clemencywarning           The chance of this prisoner being granted clemency is currently above the State Approved safe level. If you proceed with this execution, you will be held personally responsible if it is later found he would have been granted clemency.

regimetooltip_nothing                   Prisoners are locked in their cells. They have nothing to do but reflect on the choices they made that led them to this place.\n\nLong stretches of lockup can prove a decisive punishment to even the hardest of prisoners.
regimetooltip_sleep                     Prisoners are locked in their cells, and the lights are turned out. Everyone goes to sleep.\n\nExcept those who are digging escape tunnels...
regimetooltip_eat                       Prisoners make their way to the nearest accessible canteen and sit down for lunch.\n\nPrisoners are permitted to use any facilities within the Canteen, but are not allowed to leave until this period ends.
regimetooltip_shower                    Prisoners strip off their clothes and get into the showers. Daily shower time is essential for prisoner hygiene, but some inmates will simply not bother unless forced to do so.
regimetooltip_yard                      Prisoners are let out of the facility and into the yard for some much needed exercise, sunlight and fresh air.\n\nPrisoners will make use of any facilities within the yard during this time, like the weight benches for working out, telephones to call loved ones, showers etc.
regimetooltip_work                      Prisoners are put to work around the prison.  Any job openings will be filled and prisoners will automatically report to their job locations. (You can set up job openings from the Deployment screen.)\n\nAll Reform programs also take place during Work time.  Prisoners without a job and not currently assigned to a Reform program are free to roam around the prison as if under 'Freetime'.
regimetooltip_freetime                  Prisoners are let out of their cell and are permitted to use any facilities around the prison. Prisoners enjoy this time best of all, and will socialise and take care of their needs as best they can.\n\nLong periods of free time can reduce the stress and tension within your prison, but many believe it hardly counts as punishment.

regime_clear                            Clear the regime for this category of prisoner, and use the default Normal Security regime instead.

execution_result_ok                     The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. The standard compensation of $10,000 is awarded to the institution for their part in this process.
execution_result_appealed               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, new information came to light after the fact that would have affected his appeal for clemency, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_innocent               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, evidence was later uncovered that revealed *N's innocence, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_illegal                The execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the discovery of information that would have ultimately resulted in a successful appeal, the institution is fined $50,000. Due to the failure to follow proper protocol, executions are suspended until a later date, and any remaining Death Row prisoners will be transferred to another facility. 
execution_result_illegalinnocent        The illegal execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the fact that *N was innocent of his crimes, the administrator of this facility is terminated from their position, effective immediately. 
execution_warning_one                   Should the next execution performed here not follow the correct procedure, you will be fired from your position.
execution_warning_two                   Due to your past failures to follow correct procedure, one more breach of protocol in this manner will result in you being fired from your position.

ceos_letter                             Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nCongratulations on completing your basic induction - you are now a fully qualified Prison Architect!  Soon you'll be designing, building and running your own prisons starting from nothing but an empty plot of land and a few stacks of bricks.  Before you get started, I thought I might share some important lessons with you.\n\n1. Every prison needs a Warden - he should be one of your first hires.  Build him a nice office and he'll open up a whole range of advanced facilities via the bureaucracy system.\n\n2. Individual jail cells are expensive, especially early on when funds are very tight.  Save money by starting with a single large Holding Cell, which can be shared between many prisoners at once.\n\n3. Get your Kitchen and Canteen up and running before the first prisoners show up, and be sure to hire some Cooks - nothing irritates a prisoner more than an empty stomach!\n\n4. Many items require a water connection.  Water is provided by a Water Pump Station, and pipes are built in the Utilities view.  Use Small Pipes to connect individual items together, then use Large Pipes to connect back to the station.  Small pipes can only carry water so far before they lose pressure.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.\n\nps.

adviser_deathrow_murder1                I knew I'd catch you two here.

adviser_deathrow_murder25               Don't.  Just....Don't.
adviser_deathrow_murder3                What are you going to do?

adviser_deathrow_church1                Can I help you?
adviser_deathrow_church15               ...
adviser_deathrow_church2                Are you looking for forgiveness?
adviser_deathrow_church3                I don't know. I have to do something, I can't live with the things I've done.
adviser_deathrow_church4                You have to turn yourself in. Whatever you've done, you cannot evade the consequences. 
adviser_deathrow_church5                You will never be able to live with yourself until you face up to your past.
adviser_deathrow_church6                I want to go back. I want to forgive her. I want her to forgive me.
adviser_deathrow_church7                God will forgive you, no matter what you have done, if you ask him to. 
adviser_deathrow_church8                But you must answer for your crimes in the eyes of the law.  There is no other way.

adviser_deathrowintro_1                 This is a tough one.
adviser_deathrowintro_2                 There's a prisoner incarcerated at this facility who's been convicted of a double murder, and sentenced to death.  
adviser_deathrowintro_3                 That's where we come in.  We've been contracted to construct an execution chamber in time for the guy's big day.
adviser_deathrowintrob_1                This is where I want the new facility to be built.
adviser_deathrowintrob_2                The first step with any project like this is to construct the building itself - with enough space inside to fit an execution room and a holding cell.
adviser_deathrowintrob_3                So let's get started.  Construct a new building here.

adviser_deathrow_explain1               Your Workmen are responsible for the construction of buildings.
adviser_deathrow_explain2               They'll collect the steel and concrete from this store room and take it to the construction site.
adviser_deathrow_explain3               They'll use those raw materials to build the foundations and framework of your new building.
adviser_deathrow_explain4               This is the slowest part of construction, so you should plan ahead when building new facilities.
adviser_deathrow_explain5               While we wait, take a look around.  Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

objective_deathrow_building             Construct a building to house the Execution Facility

adviser_deathrow_buildinside1           We will also need an entrance to the new Execution Facility.
adviser_deathrow_buildinside2           Build a Large Jail Door into the south wall.

objective_deathrow_buildouterdoor       Build a Large Jail Door entrance

adviser_deathrow_internalwalls1          Inside the building I want a Cell and an Execution Room.
adviser_deathrow_internalwalls2          Partition the space by constructing some Brick Walls.

objective_deathrow_buildinternalwalls   Build internal walls

adviser_deathrow_internaldoors1          Now add Large Jail Doors to those dividing walls.
adviser_deathrow_internaldoors2          You can rotate an object before placement by clicking the middle mouse button (or press R).

objective_deathrow_buildinternaldoors   Build internal doors (Middle Click or press R to rotate an object)

adviser_deathrow_designation1           That's looking good.  We now need to Designate Rooms within those spaces.
adviser_deathrow_designation2           Designate a Cell in the smaller area where our condemned inmate will live.
adviser_deathrow_designation3           Then designate the Execution Room itself in the larger area.

objective_deathrow_designatecell        Designate a Cell
objective_deathrow_designateexecution   Designate an Execution Room

adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements1      Those new Rooms have requirements before they become functional.  
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements2      The Cell needs a Bed and a Toilet.
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements3      The Execution Room requires the Electric Chair.

objective_deathrow_cellobjects1         Build a Bed
objective_deathrow_cellobjects2         Build a Toilet
objective_deathrow_executionobjects     Build an Electric Chair

adviser_deathrow_optional1              That's the essentials taken care of.  But there are still a few improvements you could make.
adviser_deathrow_optional2              It's up to you though, these aren't strictly required.  It depends how much you care about your prisoners and their environment.
adviser_deathrow_optional3              The Cell itself could be improved with an outward facing Window, and a small Bookshelf.  
adviser_deathrow_optional4              And the facility would look better with a higher quality floor material - like Wooden Floorboards or Mosaic Tiles.
adviser_deathrow_optional5              Outside you could add some lighting, and a paved pathway if you think it needs it.

adviser_deathrow_transfer05             This is the man in question, Edward Romsey.  A teacher once, would you believe.
adviser_deathrow_transfer06             It's not our place to decide if he deserves this.  The Law has made that decision.  We're just here to do a job.
adviser_deathrow_transfer1              Once you are satisfied the facility is ready, you can begin the Prisoner Transfer to his new cell.
adviser_deathrow_transfer2              Simply click on the polaroid in his cell to initiate the transfer.

objective_deathrow_path                 (OPTIONAL) Build a Path to the new facility
objective_deathrow_window               (OPTIONAL) Add a Window to the Cell
objective_deathrow_bookshelf            (OPTIONAL) Add a bookshelf to the Cell
objective_deathrow_flooring             (OPTIONAL) Redo the flooring with higher quality materials
objective_deathrow_outerlights          (OPTIONAL) Create some outdoor lighting around the facility
objective_deathrow_transferinmate       When you are done, begin the Prisoner Transfer by clicking on the polaroid in Edward's cell.

adviser_deathrow_setupmurder1           Don't shed one tear for this guy.  He's a stone cold killer, guilty as charged. 
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder2           He even confessed.  Wanna hear his description of what he did?  
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder3           It's juicy stuff.  "It was around 11pm.  The lights were already on.  I knew she was home..."
adviser_deathrow_postmurder1            Like I said, a stone cold killer.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder2            Clear as day if you ask me.  Deserves every volt he's gonna get.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder3            All men deserve forgiveness, even him. Are you so sure in yourself that you can deal out such final judgement?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder4            Catching your wife with another man is no excuse for what he did. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder5            And he went there with a loaded gun, knowing he'd find them together. That's double pre-meditated murder.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder6            He's done nothing but co-operate with the authorities. This state is making an example of him. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder7            If he'd committed his crime 100 miles north he'd be looking at life imprisonment instead. How is that justice?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder8            Do you want a guy like this running free? I'll sleep just fine at night when I know he's gone.
           

adviser_deathrowelectricity_1           Good work so far.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_2           However there is one problem - the execution room isn't functioning yet, because it doesn't have any power.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_3           We need to connect it to the electrical supply.

adviser_deathrowelectricityb_1          We are now viewing the prison in Utilities mode, which shows us the electrical wiring layout for the entire prison. 
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_2          Each building in the prison is connected to the Power Grid by these thick underground electrical cables.  
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_3          Power is provided to the prison by this substation, which draws electricity from the national grid.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4          As you can see, this entire wing of prison cells is without power.  All of the lights are out.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4b         To fix this problem, we first need to switch into Utilities mode to understand why the lights are without power.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_5          The nearest electrical cables are too far away - our engineers can't complete the wiring for this area.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_6          Extend the electrical cables nearby to cover this wing of the prison.

objective_deathrow_cellpower            Connect the rooms to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_connectchair_1         Lights aren't the only thing that needs power.  Your new Electric Chair does too.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_2         Use the Power Cables to connect the execution facility to the power grid.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_3         The Electric Chair itself is a special type of electrical item.  It requires its own dedicated power line. You'll need to connect it up directly with mains cables.

objective_deathrow_chairpower           Connect the Electric Chair to the Electrical Supply
objective_deathrow_condemnedcellpower   Connect the Cell to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_testchair_1            We are almost done I think.  We should test the new Execution room at least once before we try to use it though.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_2            I'm just going to turn it on for a few seconds, make sure everything is ok.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_3            Well, that didn't work.  Looks like we drew too much power, and tripped a circuit breaker in the power station.  The whole prison is dark.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_4            We're going to need more juice to be able to handle the power spike that the electric chair generates.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5            First, we need to turn the power back on.   This is a two step process:
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5b           Switch the power station back on by clicking on it.  
adviser_deathrow_testchair_6            Then build three more capacitors so we have enough Power Capacity to handle the electric chair.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_7            Once you've done that, test the Electric chair again by clicking on it in Utilities Mode to turn it on.

objective_deathrow_poweron              Turn the Power Station back on. (In Utilities Mode, click on the Power Station to restart it)
objective_deathrow_expandpower          Expand the power station with three new Capacitors
objective_deathrow_chairworking         Test the chair again (click on it in Utilities Mode to turn it on)

adviser_deathrow_execution_1            Well done.  I believe we are finished with this job.
adviser_deathrow_execution_2            What happens now is out of our hands.  We did a professional job, and that's important in our business.
adviser_deathrow_execution_3            Try not to worry about what happens next.  

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution1        It is time Edward. 
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution2        You have done the right thing, even though this world will not forgive you for it.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution3        You will be with God soon, and He will have the final judgement on you.

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution4        Edward Romsey.  You have been found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution5        The penalty is death.  
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution6        Do you have anything to say?
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution7        Susan...
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution8        I'm sorry.

event_waterpipeburst                    A water pipe has burst and is flooding the area. Fix it before the damage becomes too severe.
event_bulkintake                        A disaster at a nearby prison has rendered a whole section of the facility unusable. We have no choice but to transfer the prisoners there to your prison, as there are no other suitable facilities nearby. They will be arriving soon.
event_workshopaccident                  A prisoner has been seriously wounded in a workshop accident, and can't be moved! Send a doctor, quickly!
event_subsidence                        Subsidence of the land has destroyed a section of our outer wall. You should have it repaired, immediately! 
event_earthquake                        A local earthquake has caused a section of the prison to collapse! 
event_virus                             We've been getting reports of sickness from a number of prisoners. It might be worth identifying and quarantining the infected to stop it from spreading. 
event_virus_x                           We've been getting reports of sickness from a number of prisoners, and the symptoms seem quite severe. You should consider quarantining the sick and treating them before it spreads too far. 

event_massassassination_1               The identities of a number of witnesses in a federal prosecution case have been leaked, and some of them are inmates in our prison.
event_massassassination_2               Hits have been taken out on them, but we need them alive. You need to identify the prisoners and keep them in one piece until their court date comes up.
event_massassassination_3_x             We're learning about this late, so you don't have much time before these hits go live. 

event_tvremovaldemand_1                 The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's brining a lot of heat on my office.
event_tvremovaldemand_2                 I'm passing a bill which bans TVs in common areas in prisons, so I need you to remove all TVs from your common rooms or you will be fined. You have 12 hours.
event_tvremovaldemand_fine              You've failed to remove TVs from your common rooms, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will receive increasingly severe fines until you comply. 
event_tvremovaldemand_complete          The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning TVs from common areas has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_weightsremovaldemand_1            The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's brining a lot of heat on my office.
event_weightsremovaldemand_2            I'm passing a bill which bans exercise equipment in prison yards, so I need you to remove all Weights Benches from your Yards or you will be fined. You have 12 hours.
event_weightsremovaldemand_fine         You've failed to remove all Weights Benches from your yards, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will receive increasingly severe fines until you comply. 
event_weightsremovaldemand_complete     The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning weights benches from yards has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_lessfooddemand_1                  The board has decided to experiment with a number of cost-saving measures across our facilities, and your prison is being included.
event_lessfooddemand_2                  We need you to reduce the meal quantity and meal variation policies in your prison to low, so we can see what effect this has on overall budgets.
event_lessfooddemand_fine               Since you've decided not to implement the new food policies we've asked for, we're going to take the potential savings directly from your funds. This will continue to happen until you do as I've asked.
event_lessfooddemand_complete           The food budget experiment is over and the results are inconclusive. You are free to set your food policies back to whatever you wish.

event_removevisitationdemand_1          An incident at another facility has highlighted potential issues with security checks when it comes to family visitation in prisons.
event_removevisitationdemand_2          Until the processes can be properly reviewed, all visitation must be suspended. You have 6 hours to remove all Visitation rooms from your prison.
event_removevisitationdemand_fine       You have failed to remove the Visitation rooms from your prison, despite the current security issues. You've been fined, and will continue to be fined until you comply. 
event_removevisitationdemand_complete   We've completed our security review of the visitation process, and Visitation rooms can now be re-added to your prison if you choose. 

event_lessworkdemand_1                  I've just received word that the prisoners are unhappy with how much time they have to work during the day, and are planning to cause trouble if it isn't reduced.
event_lessworkdemand_2                  A guard overheard someone say that if they had to work for more than 2 hours they were going to "tear this place apart."
event_lessworkdemand_ignore             It looks like the prisoners have given up and settled down. They aren't happy about it, but it's good to show them who's boss around here.
event_lessworkdemand_complete           The prisoners have settled down about their work hours now - I guess they saw the last few days as something of a vacation. We can put them back to work without trouble.       

event_moresleepdemand_1                 We've received complaints that the prisoners aren't allowed to sleep enough, and are getting very irritable about it.
event_moresleepdemand_2                 They've said that if they aren't given at least 7 hours of sleep a night, they are going to start causing trouble. 
event_moresleepdemand_ignore            Looks like the prisoners have finally run out of steam and given up their protests about lack of sleep. Guess they were too tired.
event_moresleepdemand_complete          The whole issue with the prisoners' sleep schedules has finally blown over, so you can change them again without issue if you want.

event_morefreetimedemand_1              The prisoners are apparently unhappy with how little free time they have in their daily schedules.
event_morefreetimedemand_2              The guards have been hearing whispers that if things don't change soon, the prisoners are going to start causing some damage.
event_morefreetimedemand_ignore         The prisoners have settled down and stopped causing trouble over their lack of free time. Maybe they realised they'd have even less if they are always in solitary.
event_morefreetimedemand_complete       The prisoners demands for more free time have been indulged for long enough, so you can feel free to change their schedule again as you wish.
